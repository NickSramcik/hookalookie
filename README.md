# Hookalookie Portfolio
This project is a portfolio page for an extremely eccentric performer of magic. It is responsive, and features a carosel of rotating thumbnails.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript

This website was built to be visually appealing on any device. (I have not been able to test it on a smart refrigerator yet...) It uses a CSS preprocessor (SASS) to make use of extra styling features. The layout is built via flexbox with media queries to make the website responsive to smaller devices. 

## Optimizations

Images are tricky to adjust with how the CSS is designed to work on this project. Images need to be a specific size or they will be positioned awkwardly, sometimes cutting into other sections. I'd like to look into an alternate method of rendering the images that's a little more flexible and easy to work with. 

## Lessons Learned:

For all the challenges this layout presented, I think it was worth it in the end. The result is a clean, smooth, responsive experience that looks really nice on any device, in my personal opinion.
